PURPOSE:
We often see people struggling to find blood during medical emergencies and now, during this Covid-19 pandemic, pleas for plasma from newly recovered patients on social media has become frequent. The purpose of this project is to help patients looking for blood or plasma get easy and quick access to a database which holds information (live) about donors/blood banks at the nearest proximity of the patient.

Functional Requirements: 
Search option to find blood/plasma by type/group. Registration and log in information are stored in database from website. Stores location of donors, hospitals and blood banks, phone number, blood type, and other required information for blood donation and acceptance.  Lists the nearest blood banks/ hospitals and notifies nearest donors when their type of blood is required. Based on the response of donors, searchers are presented/emailed with name and contact information of the donor.
Uses primary, foreign and unique keys to maintain data integrity and avoid data redundancy. Uses all the functions: where, like, select from, join, etc. 

USER INPUT
The patient is considered the first-hand user here. The donors are part of the database, and will only fill out the registration form once, and be prepared to be contacted for donation when required. The donors will provide their preferred location. The patient will input the required blood type, name of the hospital, address, name of the patient and contact number along. The database will find the donor/blood bank at the nearest proximity and provide the user(patient) with the required information. The donor will get live update from the service and respond immediately as available/unavailable.
Number of Tables: 
6-9
